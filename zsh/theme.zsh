# Originally this was the blinks zsh theme. I've made extensive modifications
# to it over the years.
#
# Features
#
# * Fast - This shell prompt provides a lot of info but is designed to be fast.
#   The prompt always renders in less than 10ms on my systems.
# * Compact - I don't always have a lot of screen space so keeping the format
#   compact ensure I'll be able to see everything, even if it is in a small
#   tmux pane.
# * Informative - A lot of shells don't provide any indication of what happens
#   when a command finishes. This prompt displays the exit code and the duration
#   of a command when it renders the next prompt
# * Designed for light mode - dark mode is generally the default, but I use
#   light mode.
#
# Format
#
# * Left prompt only. No right prompt.
# * All values are left aligned.
# * Top line: current directory, exit code, duration of last command, Git info.
# * Bottom line: current user, `%` for prompt char
