= Vim Server

Vim's `--servername` fetaure allows another program/shell (client) to issue a command in an already running Vim instance (server). See `:h client-server` for details. This is useful in tmux where we may want to issue a command in one pane to open a file in a vim instance running in another pane.

Basic usage:

[source, sh]
----
# in terminal A open vim with
vim --servername s1

# in terminal B execute, vim instance in terminal A will open file
vim --servername s1 --remote someotherfile.txt
----

== Opening Elixir Modules in Vim

[source, sh]
----
export ELIXIR_EDITOR="vim +__LINE__ __FILE__"
export ELIXIR_EDITOR='vim --servername s1 "+call cursor(__LINE__, 1)" "__FILE__"'
----
