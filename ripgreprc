# Ripgrep (rg) config file

# Don't let limit number of columns output by ripgrep as I may want to pipe the
# full lines to another command. Currently, ripgrep doesn't provide a way to
# only limit line length when output is going to an interactive terminal.
# So I don't use these settings and live with the occasional long line.
#--max-columns=80
#--max-columns-preview

# Include .github directory in search results
--ignore-file=$HOME/.ignore

# Because who cares about case!?
