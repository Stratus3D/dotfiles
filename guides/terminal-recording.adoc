= Recording the Terminal

== Recording

=== Setup a tmux Session Optimized for Recording

[source, sh]
----
# Create new tmux session for recording
$ tmux new-session -s recording-studio

# Run the resize-window command to set tmux window to good size for recording
:resize-window -y 24 -x 80
----

TODO: Figure out best prompt for recording.

=== Generate the Recording

Inside the tmux session configured for terminal record, begin the recording:

[source, sh]
----
$ asciinema rec -t <title> <recording file name>

# Do what you want to record
# Ctrl-D to exit
----

== Converting to an Animated GIF

Sometimes it's necessary to convert the terminal record into a format that can be viewed anywhere.

The asciinema `agg` tool converts asciinema recordings into animated GIFs. The generated GIF file
can then be converted to another format like MP4.

Steps:

1. Install link:https://github.com/asciinema/agg[asciinema/agg].
2. Run `agg <ASCIINEMA FILE> <OUTPUT GIF FILE>` with any options you want.

=== Converting the GIF to an MP4 Video

Steps:

1. Install `ffmpeg` if you don't already have it installed.
2. Run `ffmpeg -i <GIF FILE> -movflags faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" <OUTPUT MP4 FILE>`
