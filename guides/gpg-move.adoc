= Moving GPG Private and Public Keys to Another Computer

== Find your key ID

----
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
----

Sample output:

----
pub   4096R/ABC12345 2020-01-01 [expires: 2025-12-31]
uid                  Your Name <user@example.com>
sub   4096R/DEF67890 2020-01-01 [expires: 2025-12-31]
----

The key ID is on a line starting with `pub` and is the value following the slash. In the example above it is `ABC12345`.

== Export the secret key to file

----
$ gpg --export-secret-keys YOUR_ID_HERE > private.key
----

== Copy the file to the new computer

Use a secure method of transferring the file. Avoid transferring over the internet and instead use something like a new flash drive that has never been plugged into an untrusted machine.

== Import the key

----
$ gpg --import private.key
----
