== Converting to an Animated GIF

Sometimes it's necessary to convert the terminal record into a format that can be viewed anywhere.

The asciinema `agg` tool converts asciinema recordings into animated GIFs. The generated GIF file
can then be converted to another format like MP4.

Steps:

1. Install link:https://github.com/asciinema/agg[asciinema/agg].
2. Run `agg <ASCIINEMA FILE> <OUTPUT GIF FILE>` with any options you want.

=== Converting the GIF to an MP4 Video

Steps:

1. Install `ffmpeg` if you don't already have it installed.
2. Run `ffmpeg -i <GIF FILE> -movflags faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" <OUTPUT MP4 FILE>`
