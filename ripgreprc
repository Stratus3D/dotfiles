# Ripgrep (rg) config file

# Don't let limit number of columns output by ripgrep as I may want to pipe the
# full lines to another command. Currently, ripgrep doesn't provide a way to
# only limit line length when output is going to an interactive terminal.
# So I don't use these settings and live with the occasional long line.
#--max-columns=80
#--max-columns-preview

# Search hidden files by default. This is useful because we typically do want to
# search dotfiles and directories like .github
--hidden

# A special case is the .git directory. We rarely want to search it. If we do
# want to search it with this setting in place we can just cd inside .git and
# repeat the search.
